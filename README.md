# TextClassification

The dataset have twp columns :comment text and Labels. The comment text in the dataset are classified as negative and positive. 

The different machine learning techniques like Support vector machine, Random forest, logistic regression and Na√Øve Bayes to classify 
the text as positive and negative. Also, different feature selection techniques like PCA and Chi square along with the different 
feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF, count vectorization and frequency vectorization are applied in order to increase accuracy of 
our classifiers.

Decision trees performed best for first dataset with given accuracy 78% and Random forest gave 83.95% accuracy. In both the datasets count 
vectorization performed well.
